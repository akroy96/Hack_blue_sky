What can be done ?
For custom Deep Learning models I have used only 3 day history and 1 day future.
We can try 1 day,2 day and 4 day history
Most of the time last 24 points also considered by padding them with edge value.
When I find what fraction of data is being padding I find that 24 out of 96 are being padded that is  1/4th of that data is valued wrong that can be removed in future.

Most of the models are trained and tested only on CO can be done on both datas

Hyper parameter tuning can be done.
